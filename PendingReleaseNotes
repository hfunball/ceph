* If you have manually specified the monitor user rocksdb via the
  ``mon keyvaluedb = rocksdb`` option, you will need to manually add a file
  to the mon data directory to preserve this option::

     echo rocksdb > /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-`hostname`/kv_backend

  New monitors will now use rocksdb by default, but if that file is
  not present, existing monitors will use leveldb.  The ``mon keyvaluedb`` option
  now only affects the backend chosen when a monitor is created.
